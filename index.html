            The universe is a name that we use to describe the collection of all
            things that exist in space. It is made of trillions of stars,
            galaxies, black holes, enormous clouds of gas and many other
            fascinating things

          The Universe contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions
          or billions of stars. The space between the stars and galaxies is
          largely empty. However, even places far from stars and planets contain
          scattered particles of dust or a few hydrogen atoms per cubic
          centimeter. Space is also filled with radiation (e.g. light and heat),
          magnetic fields and high energy particles (e.g. cosmic rays). The
          Universe is incredibly huge. It would take a modern jet fighter more
          than a million years to reach the nearest star to the Sun. Travelling
          at the speed of light (300,000 km per second), it would take 100,000
          years to cross our Milky Way galaxy alone. No one knows the exact size
          of the Universe, because we cannot see the edge – if there is one. All
          we do know is that the visible Universe is at least 93 billion light
          years across. (A light year is the distance light travels in one year
          – about 9 trillion km.) The Universe has not always been the same
          size. Scientists believe it began in a Big Bang, which took place
          nearly 14 billion years ago. Since then, the Universe has been
          expanding outward at very high speed. So the area of space we now see
          is billions of times bigger than it was when the Universe was very
          young. The galaxies are also moving further apart as the space between
          them expands.

          Today, scientists are not so sure that life began on or near the
          Earth's surface. Everywhere we look, there seems to be life – even
          several kilometres underground. It may be that life began at the
          bottom of the oceans, where hot springs provided energy instead of
          sunlight. Another idea is that life – or at least the chemical
          building blocks – came from space. Many comets were crashing into
          Earth early in its history. Comets are rich in carbon-based chemicals
          from which life could have started. It is also possible that life
          could transfer from one planet to another. It seems that life is tough
          enough to survive a long journey through space. A large comet or
          meteorite crashing into the Earth could throw large numbers of rocks
          into space. Any bacteria that are riding as passengers on these rocks
          could eventually land on another planet. In the same way, a meteorite
          from Mars could carry Martian life (if it existed) to Earth. In 1996,
          scientists told the world that they had found just such a Martian rock
          in Antarctica. However, other scientists question their research.

          “ 'THE BIG-BANG' We are an impossibility in an impossible universe.”
        </p>

        <p class="class3 text-small">
          Most astronomers believe the Universe began in a Big Bang about 14
          billion years ago. At that time, the entire Universe was inside a
          bubble that was thousands of times smaller than a pinhead. It was
          hotter and denser than anything we can imagine. Then it suddenly
          exploded. The Universe that we know was born. Time, space and matter
          all began with the Big Bang. In a fraction of a second, the Universe
          grew from smaller than a single atom to bigger than a galaxy. And it
          kept on growing at a fantastic rate. It is still expanding today. As
          the Universe expanded and cooled, energy changed into particles of
          matter and antimatter. These two opposite types of particles largely
          destroyed each other. But some matter survived. More stable particles
          called protons and neutrons started to form when the Universe was one
          second old. Over the next three minutes, the temperature dropped below
          1 billion degrees Celsius. It was now cool enough for the protons and
          neutrons to come together, forming hydrogen and helium nuclei. After
          300 000 years, the Universe had cooled to about 3000 degrees. Atomic
          nuclei could finally capture electrons to form atoms. The Universe
          filled with clouds of hydrogen and helium gas.
